# Instagram_Automation

This project contains an automation script by which, you can 'like' selected number of posts (given by the user) of any certain page on Instagram, with a delay of time (for eg of 1 second). This makes sure that any bot activity isn't traced by that particular social media platform. This is a simple yet elegant automation script written using Node.js and Puppeteer. The user has to just run the 'index' file from VS Code and provide the number (integer value) of posts that have to be liked. We can change the profile by just changing the name in the script written. 

Any more feedbacks/suggestions to make it more responsive are welcomed.
